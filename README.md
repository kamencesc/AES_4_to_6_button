# AES 4 to 6 button
A board to use a 4 button AES stick/gamepad on to a Supergun with a DB15 6 button layout.

It uses a ATtiny84 for the logic and then send the correct button push to the Supergun.

The code uses by default this config:

A = Light Punch
B = Heavy Punch
A + B = Middle Punch
C = Light Kick
D = Heavy Kick
C + D = Middle Kick

Feel free to modify to adapt at your own preferences.
